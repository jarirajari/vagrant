System = Platform + Application

Phases:
1. Create VM
2. VM OS gets installed and then a script updates it
3. Install and configure platform (independent)
4. Install and configure application (specific)
5. Run system: start services and other processes...

Finally, just "vagrant ssh".

Note! Here Application means application specific 
software etc. not the deployable application itself!
For example, it is possible to install a database as a 
part of "platform" but then run some database init-
ialization scripts at "application" phase: e.g. 
create database, create users, grant rights to the 
users, create tables and populate them...
